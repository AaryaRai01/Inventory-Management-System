## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.0 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AaryaRai01/Inventory-Management-System.git](https://github.com/AaryaRai01/Inventory-Management-System.git)
    cd Inventory-Management-System
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Your Supabase Backend**
    -   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
    -   Inside your project, navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
    -   Run the following schema to create the `products` table:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE products (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
          name TEXT NOT NULL,
          price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
          quantity INT NOT NULL,
          category TEXT,
          created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
        );
        ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    -   In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
    -   In your Supabase project, go to **Project Settings > API**.
    -   Copy your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**.
    -   Paste them into your `.env.local` file like this:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```

5.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üåê API Endpoints

The backend is handled by Next.js API routes. Here are the available endpoints:

| Method | Path                  | Description                      |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
